# Branch and Bound Method

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: High
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Branch and Bound (BB) method is an algorithm design paradigm used to solve discrete optimization, combinatorial optimization, and mathematical optimization problems. <core_idea>: The core idea of the Branch and Bound method is to partition the feasible solution space into multiple subspaces (branches) and calculate a bound for each subspace (bounding). This helps to exclude subspaces that cannot contain the optimal solution, thereby reducing the search range and improving solving efficiency. <application>: The Branch and Bound method is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Integer programming problems: such as the knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem, etc. Mixed integer programming problems: involving optimization problems with both integer and continuous variables. Combinatorial optimization problems: such as graph coloring, maximum clique problem, etc.
