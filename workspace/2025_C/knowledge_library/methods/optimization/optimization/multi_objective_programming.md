# Multi-Objective Programming

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Multi-Objective Programming is a mathematical optimization method aimed at optimizing multiple conflicting objective functions simultaneously. <core_idea>: It introduces weights or constraints to transform multiple objectives into a single optimization problem, allowing trade-offs among different objectives. <application>: Multi-Objective Programming is widely used in engineering design, resource allocation, and production scheduling, particularly suitable for complex optimization problems requiring trade-offs among multiple objectives.
