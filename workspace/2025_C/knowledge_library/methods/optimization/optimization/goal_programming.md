# Goal Programming

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Goal Programming is a mathematical optimization method aimed at simultaneously satisfying multiple objectives. <core_idea>: It transforms multiple objectives into a set of constraints and optimizes decision variables to achieve a balance among the objectives. <application>: Goal Programming is widely used in production scheduling, resource allocation, and project management, especially suitable for optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives.
