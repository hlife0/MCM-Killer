# Multi-level Programming

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: High

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Multi-level Programming is a mathematical optimization method that deals with hierarchical decision-making problems where decision-makers at different levels have different objectives and constraints. <core_idea>: It models the interactions and constraints among decision-makers at different levels to find the optimal solution for the overall system. <application>: Multi-level Programming is widely used in economics, management, and engineering design, particularly suitable for describing and solving complex decision-making problems with hierarchical relationships.
