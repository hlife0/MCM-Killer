# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: High
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. It describes a scenario where a salesman needs to visit a series of cities, each city only once, and finally return to the starting city. The goal is to find the shortest possible route. <core_idea>: The core idea of TSP is to find the shortest path that visits all cities exactly once through mathematical modeling. <application>: TSP is widely used in logistics distribution, production scheduling, path planning, and other fields, especially suitable for optimization problems that require selecting the optimal path among multiple locations. For example, in logistics distribution, TSP can help design the shortest delivery route, reducing transportation costs and time. It is important to note that TSP is an NP-hard problem, and the difficulty of solving it increases exponentially with the number of cities. Therefore, heuristic or approximation algorithms are often used in practical applications to find satisfactory solutions. Methods such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and genetic algorithms are used to solve TSP.
