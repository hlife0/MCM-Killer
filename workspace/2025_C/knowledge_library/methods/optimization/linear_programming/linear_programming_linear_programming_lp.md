# Linear Programming (Linear Programming, LP)

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical optimization method used to maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. <core_idea>: It helps decision-makers achieve optimal decisions under limited resources. <application>: It is widely used in resource allocation, production planning, and transportation scheduling.
