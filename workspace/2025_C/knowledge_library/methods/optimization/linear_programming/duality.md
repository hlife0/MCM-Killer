# Duality

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: High
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: In mathematics and optimization, duality refers to the process of transforming an optimization problem into another related problem. The dual problem is closely related to the original problem (called the primal problem), and studying duality helps to understand the structure of the problem deeply and provides effective methods for solving it. <core_idea>: The core idea of duality is to construct a dual problem related to the primal problem and use the solution of the dual problem to derive the solution of the primal problem. In many cases, there is a specific relationship between the optimal solutions of the primal and dual problems, such as weak duality and strong duality. <application>: Duality is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Linear programming problems: duality theory plays an important role in solving linear programming problems. Weak duality: the optimal value of the dual problem does not exceed the optimal value of the primal problem. Strong duality: under certain conditions, the optimal values of the primal and dual problems are equal. Convex optimization problems: duality provides strong theoretical support in convex optimization. Lagrangian duality: by introducing Lagrange multipliers, constraints are converted into a dual function, thereby constructing a dual problem. Support vector machines (SVM): in machine learning, the dual problem of SVM simplifies the solving process through duality. Network flow problems: in network optimization, duality is used to analyze and solve maximum flow, minimum cost flow, and other problems.
