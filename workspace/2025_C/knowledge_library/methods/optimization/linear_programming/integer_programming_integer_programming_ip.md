# Integer Programming (Integer Programming, IP)

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Integer Programming (IP) is a mathematical optimization method that requires decision variables to take integer values. <core_idea>: It is particularly suitable for optimization problems requiring discrete decisions. <application>: It is widely used in production scheduling, logistics management, and resource allocation.
