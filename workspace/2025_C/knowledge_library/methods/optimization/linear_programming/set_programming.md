# Set Programming

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Set Programming is a mathematical optimization method designed to handle optimization problems where decision variables take on values from sets. <core_idea>: It introduces concepts from set theory to transform the problem into relationships and operations between sets, thereby finding the optimal solution. <application>: Set Programming is widely used in combinatorial optimization, resource allocation, and scheduling problems, particularly suitable for complex optimization problems with discrete set-valued variables.
