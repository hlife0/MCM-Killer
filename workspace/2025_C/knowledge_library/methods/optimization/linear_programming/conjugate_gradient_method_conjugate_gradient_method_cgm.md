# Conjugate Gradient Method (Conjugate Gradient Method, CGM)

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) is an iterative method for solving symmetric positive definite linear systems, particularly suitable for large sparse matrices. <core_idea>: The core idea of the Conjugate Gradient Method is to construct a set of conjugate directions and perform linear searches in each direction to gradually approach the solution of the linear system. <application>: The Conjugate Gradient Method is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Solving linear systems: particularly suitable for linear systems with symmetric positive definite coefficient matrices. Unconstrained optimization problems: when the objective function is quadratic, the Conjugate Gradient Method can effectively find the optimal solution.
