# Back Propagation Neural Network (BP Neural Network)

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: High
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The BP Neural Network is a type of multilayer feedforward neural network trained using the backpropagation algorithm. <core_idea>: The BP Neural Network calculates the output result through forward propagation, then compares it with the actual result to calculate the error. Next, the backpropagation algorithm is used to propagate the error backward from the output layer to the input layer, adjusting the weights and biases layer by layer to minimize the error. <application>: The BP Neural Network is widely used in the following fields: Pattern recognition: such as handwritten digit recognition, face recognition, etc. Function approximation: in complex function modeling and prediction, the BP Neural Network can effectively approximate any nonlinear function. Time series prediction: used for stock price prediction, weather forecasting, etc. Control systems: in the field of automation control, the BP Neural Network is used for system modeling and control strategy optimization.
