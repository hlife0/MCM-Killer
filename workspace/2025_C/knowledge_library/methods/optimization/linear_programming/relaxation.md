# Relaxation

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: In mathematical optimization, relaxation is a technique that transforms the original problem into a more easily solvable optimization problem by relaxing its constraints. <core_idea>: The core idea of relaxation is to make the optimization problem easier to handle by relaxing the constraints. <application>: Relaxation techniques are widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Integer programming problems: by relaxing integer constraints to continuous constraints, transforming the problem into a linear programming problem, thus utilizing efficient linear programming algorithms for solving. Combinatorial optimization problems: such as the traveling salesman problem, knapsack problem, etc., relaxation techniques can provide lower bounds for the problem, aiding the design of heuristic algorithms. Graph theory problems: in graph coloring, maximum clique, etc., relaxation techniques are used to estimate the bounds of the optimal solution and guide the search direction of algorithms.
