# Mixed Integer Programming (Mixed Integer Programming, MIP)

> **Domain**: Optimization
> **Complexity**: High
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is an optimization method that combines the characteristics of linear programming and integer programming, allowing some decision variables to be integers. <core_idea>: It integrates both continuous and discrete decision variables to solve complex optimization problems. <application>: It is widely used in production scheduling, logistics optimization, and facility location.
