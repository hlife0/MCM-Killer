# Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method proposed by American operations researcher Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s. This method decomposes complex problems into multiple levels, compares the factors at each level pairwise, and determines their relative importance to provide a scientific basis for decision-making. <core_idea>: The core idea of AHP is to decompose complex decision problems into multiple levels, such as goal level, criterion level, and alternative level. By pairwise comparison of factors at each level, a judgment matrix is constructed, the weights of each factor are calculated, and consistency checks are performed. Finally, the alternatives are comprehensively evaluated to support the decision-making process. <application>: AHP is widely used in the following fields: Supplier selection: In procurement management, evaluating the comprehensive capabilities of different suppliers, such as quality, delivery time, and price, to select the best supplier. Project evaluation: Conducting comprehensive evaluations of multiple projects, considering factors such as investment return, risk, and resource requirements, to determine the priority projects. Human resource management: In employee performance evaluation and promotion, comprehensively considering factors such as work performance, ability, and potential for scientific assessment. Product design: In new product development, evaluating the feasibility, cost, and market demand of different design schemes to select the best design. Environmental impact assessment: In environmental management, evaluating the impact of different schemes on the environment, such as pollutant emissions and resource consumption, to formulate effective environmental protection measures.
