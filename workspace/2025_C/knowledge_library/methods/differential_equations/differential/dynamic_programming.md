# Dynamic Programming

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Dynamic Programming (DP) is a mathematical optimization method aimed at finding the optimal strategy in multi-stage decision processes. <core_idea>: It decomposes complex problems into multiple interrelated sub-problems and solves them step by step to obtain the optimal solution for the original problem. <application>: Dynamic Programming is widely used in production scheduling, resource allocation, and path planning, especially suitable for optimization problems with optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems.
