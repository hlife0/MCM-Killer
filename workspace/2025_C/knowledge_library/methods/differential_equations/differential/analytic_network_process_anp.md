# Analytic Network Process (ANP)

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: High

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is a decision-making method proposed by Professor T.L. Saaty of the University of Pittsburgh in 1996 to handle complex decision problems with internal dependencies and feedback mechanisms. <core_idea>: ANP constructs a network structure that allows interdependencies and feedback relationships between decision elements. Unlike AHP, ANP does not require elements to be independent of each other. Instead, it constructs judgment matrices to quantify the relative importance of each element and ultimately comprehensively evaluates the alternatives. <application>: ANP is widely used in the following fields: Supply chain management: Evaluating the comprehensive capabilities of different suppliers, such as quality, delivery time, and price, to select the best supplier. Project evaluation: Conducting comprehensive evaluations of multiple projects, considering factors such as investment return, risk, and resource requirements, to determine the priority projects. Human resource management: In employee performance evaluation and promotion, comprehensively considering factors such as work performance, ability, and potential for scientific assessment. Product design: In new product development, evaluating the feasibility, cost, and market demand of different design schemes to select the best design. Environmental impact assessment: In environmental management, evaluating the impact of different schemes on the environment, such as pollutant emissions and resource consumption, to formulate effective environmental protection measures.
