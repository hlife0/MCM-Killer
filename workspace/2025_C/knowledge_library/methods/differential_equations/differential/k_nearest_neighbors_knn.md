# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm widely used for classification and regression problems. <core_idea>: The basic idea of KNN is to classify or predict a sample by calculating its distance to all samples in the training set, selecting the K nearest neighbors, and determining the class or predicted value based on these neighbors. <application>: KNN is widely used in the following fields: Classification problems: such as handwritten digit recognition and text classification. Regression problems: such as house price prediction and stock price prediction. Recommendation systems: recommending items similar users liked based on historical behavior.
