# Decision Theory

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: High

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Decision Theory is the study of making optimal decisions under uncertainty and risk. It combines knowledge from mathematics, statistics, economics, philosophy, management, and psychology to help decision-makers make rational choices in complex environments. <core_idea>: The core idea of Decision Theory is to evaluate the expected utility of each option and choose the optimal one when faced with multiple alternatives and uncertain outcomes. This process typically involves the following steps: Clarify decision objectives: Clearly define the purpose and desired outcome of the decision. Identify alternatives: List all possible courses of action. Evaluate possible outcomes: Analyze the potential results of each option and their probabilities. Calculate expected utility: Compute the expected utility of each option based on the utility and probability of each outcome. Choose the optimal option: Select the option with the highest expected utility. <application>: Decision Theory is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Risk assessment and management: Evaluating and managing potential risks in finance, insurance, and other fields, and developing corresponding countermeasures. Investment decision-making: Helping investors evaluate the expected returns and risks of different investment projects and formulate investment strategies. Resource allocation: Optimizing resource allocation in production, logistics, and other fields to achieve cost minimization or benefit maximization. Strategic planning: Formulating long-term development strategies in business management and evaluating the feasibility and potential benefits of different strategic options. Policy-making: Evaluating the impact of different policy measures in public administration and formulating optimal policy solutions.
