# Naive Bayes

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Naive Bayes is a classification method based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption of feature independence. <core_idea>: The core idea of Naive Bayes is that features are independent given the class. Based on Bayes' theorem, it calculates the posterior probability of each class and selects the class with the highest posterior probability as the prediction result. <application>: Naive Bayes is widely used in the following fields: Text classification: such as spam filtering and sentiment analysis. Medical diagnosis: predicting disease types based on symptoms. Recommendation systems: predicting user preferences based on user behavior.
