# Logistic Regression

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Logistic Regression is a widely used statistical method for classification problems, aiming to predict the probability of an event occurring. <core_idea>: Logistic Regression applies the Sigmoid function to a linear combination of input features, mapping the result to between 0 and 1 to estimate the probability of an event occurring. <application>: Logistic Regression is widely used in the following fields: Binary classification problems: such as spam detection and disease diagnosis. Multiclass classification problems: Logistic Regression can also be extended for multiclass classification tasks. Probability prediction: providing probability estimates of events occurring, suitable for scenarios requiring probability output.
