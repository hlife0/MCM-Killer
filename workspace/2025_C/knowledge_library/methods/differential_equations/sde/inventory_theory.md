# Inventory Theory

> **Domain**: Differential Equations
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Inventory Theory is a branch of operations research that studies how to determine reasonable storage quantities, ordering cycles, production batches, and production cycles to ensure supply while minimizing total costs. <core_idea>: The core idea of Inventory Theory is to analyze and optimize inventory management strategies through mathematical models to balance holding costs, ordering costs, and shortage costs, thereby achieving cost minimization and service level maximization. <application>: Inventory Theory is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model: Determining the optimal order quantity to minimize total costs. Production batch model: Determining the optimal production batch size in the production process to balance production costs and holding costs. Multi-item inventory management: Determining the optimal ordering strategy for various products to achieve overall cost minimization. Stochastic demand model: Formulating inventory strategies to cope with demand fluctuations when demand is random. Shortage management: Developing shortage handling strategies, such as replenishment strategies and shortage cost calculations.
