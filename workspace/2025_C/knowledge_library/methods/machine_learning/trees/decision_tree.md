# Decision Tree

> **Domain**: Machine Learning
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Decision Tree is a widely used supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression problems, with a model structure similar to a tree diagram, making it intuitive and easy to understand. <core_idea>: Decision Tree recursively partitions the dataset, breaking down complex problems into a series of simple decision rules. Each internal node represents a judgment on a feature, each branch represents the output of the judgment, and the final leaf node represents the prediction result. This structure allows Decision Tree to clearly display the decision process, making it easy to understand and interpret. <application>: Decision Tree is widely used in the following fields: Classification problems: such as spam detection and disease diagnosis. Regression problems: such as house price prediction and sales forecasting. Feature selection: analyzing the importance of features to identify those that have the greatest impact on the prediction results.
