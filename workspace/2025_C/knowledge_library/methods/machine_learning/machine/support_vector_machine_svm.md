# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

> **Domain**: Machine Learning
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used supervised learning model for classification and regression analysis. <core_idea>: The core idea of SVM is to find an optimal hyperplane in the feature space that separates samples of different classes and maximizes the margin between the samples and the hyperplane. By introducing kernel functions, SVM can effectively handle linearly inseparable data. <application>: SVM is widely used in the following fields: Classification problems: such as text classification and image recognition. Regression problems: such as house price prediction and stock price prediction. Anomaly detection: such as credit card fraud detection and intrusion detection.
