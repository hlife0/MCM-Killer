# Graph Coloring

> **Domain**: Network Science
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Graph Coloring is a classic problem in graph theory, aiming to assign colors to the vertices or edges of a graph so that adjacent vertices or edges have different colors, using the fewest number of colors. <core_idea>: The core idea of Graph Coloring is to assign colors to vertices or edges in a graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices or edges have different colors, thereby satisfying specific constraints. <application>: Graph Coloring is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Exam Scheduling: Ensuring that no student has multiple exams at the same time in school exam scheduling. Frequency Allocation: Assigning frequencies to different signals in wireless communication to avoid interference between adjacent channels. Resource Scheduling: Scheduling machines or workers to perform tasks in production scheduling, ensuring no conflicts occur. Map Coloring: Assigning different colors to adjacent regions in map drawing to ensure adjacent regions have different colors.
