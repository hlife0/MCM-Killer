# Algebraic Representation of Graphs (Adjacency Matrix, Laplacian Matrix)

> **Domain**: Network Science
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: In graph theory, the algebraic representation of graphs is a common method to describe the structure and properties of graphs using matrices. <core_idea>: The core idea is to use matrices such as the adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix to represent the connections and relationships between nodes in a graph. <application>: This method is widely used in various fields of mathematical modeling, including network analysis, spectral graph theory, and optimization problems.
