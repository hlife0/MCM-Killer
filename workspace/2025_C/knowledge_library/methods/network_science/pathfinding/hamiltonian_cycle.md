# Hamiltonian Cycle

> **Domain**: Network Science
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: A Hamiltonian Cycle is an important concept in graph theory, referring to a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point, forming a closed loop. <core_idea>: The core idea of the Hamiltonian Cycle model is to find a path that visits each vertex in the graph exactly once and returns to the starting point, forming a closed loop. <application>: The Hamiltonian Cycle model is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): Finding the shortest path that allows a salesman to start from one city, visit each city exactly once, and return to the starting city. Path Optimization Problems: In network design, logistics distribution, and other fields, finding the optimal path to minimize cost or time. Resource Scheduling Problems: In production scheduling, task allocation, and other scenarios, optimizing the execution order of tasks to improve efficiency.
