# Steiner Tree (Steiner Tree)

> **Domain**: Network Science
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Steiner Tree is a classic problem in graph theory, aiming to find the shortest tree that connects a given set of points. <core_idea>: The core idea of the Steiner Tree is to allow the introduction of additional points (called "Steiner points") in a given set of points (called "terminal points") to construct the shortest tree that connects all terminal points. <application>: The Steiner Tree is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Network Design: In communication networks, transportation networks, and other fields, the Steiner Tree is used to design the optimal connection scheme to minimize cost or delay. Circuit Layout: In integrated circuit design, the Steiner Tree is used to optimize wiring to reduce wiring length and delay. Logistics Distribution: In logistics and supply chain management, the Steiner Tree is used to plan the optimal distribution path to reduce transportation costs.
