# Shortest Path Models (Shortest Path

> **Domain**: Network Science
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

S-T, All-Pair): <modeling_method>: Shortest Path Models are used in graph theory to find the shortest path from a starting point to an endpoint. They are widely applied in transportation networks, communication networks, and logistics optimization. <core_idea>: The core idea is to calculate the shortest paths between nodes in a graph to optimize resource usage and improve efficiency. <application>: In mathematical modeling, Shortest Path Models are mainly used to solve the following types of problems: Single-Source Shortest Path Problem (S-T): Finding the shortest paths from a single starting point to all other nodes, commonly solved using Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm. All-Pairs Shortest Path Problem: Calculating the shortest paths between any two points in a graph, commonly solved using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
