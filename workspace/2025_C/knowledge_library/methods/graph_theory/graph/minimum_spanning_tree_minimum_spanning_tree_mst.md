# Minimum Spanning Tree (Minimum Spanning Tree, MST)

> **Domain**: Graph Theory
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Medium

## Overview

<modeling_method>: The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is an important concept in graph theory, referring to a spanning tree of a connected, weighted, undirected graph that includes all vertices and has the minimum possible total edge weight. <core_idea>: The core idea of the Minimum Spanning Tree is to select a set of edges in a connected, weighted, undirected graph that connects all vertices with the minimum total weight. <application>: The Minimum Spanning Tree is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Network Design: In designing communication networks, power grids, or transportation networks, the MST algorithm is used to determine the optimal routes or paths to minimize cost or delay. Resource Allocation: In logistics distribution, pipeline laying, and other scenarios, the MST is used to plan the optimal path to reduce transportation costs or construction expenses. Image Processing: In image segmentation and image compression, the MST is used to process image data.
