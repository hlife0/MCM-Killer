# Matching Problem

> **Domain**: Graph Theory
> **Complexity**: Medium
> **Narrative Value**: Low

## Overview

<modeling_method>: Matching Problem is an important issue in mathematical modeling, aiming to pair elements from two or more sets to satisfy specific optimization goals, such as minimizing costs or maximizing benefits. <core_idea>: The core idea of the Matching Problem is to establish one-to-one or many-to-many relationships between given sets to achieve a certain optimization goal. <application>: Matching Problem is widely used in the following types of mathematical modeling problems: Assignment Problem: Assigning a set of tasks to a set of workers, where each worker can only perform one task, with the goal of minimizing total costs or maximizing total benefits. Bipartite Matching: Matching a set of nodes with another set of nodes in a bipartite graph, commonly used in resource allocation and task scheduling scenarios. Stable Marriage Problem: Pairing two groups of people to ensure that no pair would deviate from their current match to choose each other, widely used in market matching and recruitment. Many-to-Many Matching: Matching between multiple sets, suitable for complex resource allocation and scheduling problems.
