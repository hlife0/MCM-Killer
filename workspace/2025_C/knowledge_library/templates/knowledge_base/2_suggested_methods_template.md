2. **Intervention Analysis**: Evaluate policy effectiveness
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provide prediction intervals
4. **Hub Identification**: Find critical transmission nodes

### Problem Keywords Detected

|---------|-----------|-------------|

## ❌ MEDIOCRITY ALERT: Methods to AVOID

### 1. Basic SIR/SEIR (Without Network)

**Why Banned**:
- Seen in 40%+ of MCM epidemic papers
- Ignores topology effects that judges value
- No novelty or insight potential
- Cannot identify hub nodes

**Unless**: Used explicitly as baseline for comparison (Table 1: Model A).

### 2. ARIMA / Linear Regression

**Why Banned**:
- Inappropriate for epidemic dynamics (non-linear)
- Cannot capture network interactions
- No mechanistic interpretation
- Ignores compartmental structure

**Unless**: Used for time-series preprocessing only.

### 3. Simple Dijkstra / Basic Centrality

**Why Banned**:
- Undergraduate level - expected baseline
- No dynamics modeling
- Static analysis of dynamic problem

**Unless**: Used for initial network characterization (Section 2.2).

## ✅ RECOMMENDED: O-Prize Level Methods

### Method 1: SIR-Network Model ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Narrative Value**: Very High

**Why This Method**:
- Captures how network topology affects spread
- Enables identification of critical hub nodes
- Provides actionable policy insights (targeted interventions)
- Strong O-Prize track record

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
dS_i/dt = -β S_i Σ_j A_ij (I_j / N_j)
dI_i/dt = β S_i Σ_j A_ij (I_j / N_j) - γ I_i
dR_i/dt = γ I_i
```
Where A_ij is the normalized adjacency matrix from airline traffic data.

**O-Prize Examples**:
- 2019 Problem D (Ecosystem): Network model won O-Prize
- 2022 Problem F (Disinformation): SIR-Network variant used

**Why It Wins**:
1. **Topological Insight**: "Our model captures how hub seeding accelerates spread by 43%"
2. **Intervention Leverage**: "Network centrality identifies critical nodes for targeted vaccination"
3. **Uncertainty**: "We propagate parameter uncertainty, generating 95% CI bands"

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Using synthetic network → Use real airline/contact data
- Ignoring sparsity → Use sparse matrix representations
- Not validating structure → Compare multiple network topologies

**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 3-4 hours

**HMML Reference**: `knowledge_library/methods/differential_equations/epidemic/sir_network.md`

---

### Method 2: Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Narrative Value**: Very High - Enables rich uncertainty discussion

**Why This Method**:
- Naturally incorporates stochastic shocks
- Produces prediction intervals, not just point estimates
- Calibration via maximum likelihood tells a story
- Captures intrinsic randomness in transmission

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
dX_t = μ(X_t, t)dt + σ(X_t, t)dW_t
```
Where dW_t is Brownian motion and σ captures volatility.

**O-Prize Examples**:
- 2021 Problem C (Food Systems): SDE for supply chain uncertainty

**Why It Wins**:
1. **Uncertainty Native**: "SDEs naturally incorporate stochastic shocks in transmission"
2. **Discussion Gold**: "95% prediction bands show uncertainty increases over time"
3. **Calibration Story**: "We fit σ (volatility) via MLE, revealing time-varying risk"

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Choosing σ arbitrarily → Calibrate via MLE or Bayesian inference
- Wrong discretization → Use Euler-Maruyama or Milstein scheme
- Ignoring boundaries → Ensure non-negativity constraints

**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 2-3 hours

**HMML Reference**: `knowledge_library/methods/differential_equations/sde/euler_maruyama.md`

## Integration Strategy

### Recommended Hybrid

**Primary Method**: SIR-Network (macro dynamics)
**Validation Method**: SDE (uncertainty quantification)

**Rationale**:
- SIR-Network provides efficient simulation for policy exploration
- SDE validates stochastic effects and generates prediction intervals
- Together they cover both structural and random uncertainty

### Combined Narrative

> "Our multi-scale approach captures both the deterministic effects of
> network topology (SIR-Network) and intrinsic stochasticity in
> transmission (SDE validation), demonstrating robustness across
> modeling paradigms."

### Expected O-Prize Impact

| Criterion | Rating | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Novelty | High | Multi-paradigm approach rare in MCM |
| Depth | High | Two complementary methods strengthen conclusions |
| Policy Value | Very High | Network identifies hubs + SDE quantifies risk |

---

## Time Budget Recommendation

| Method | Implementation | Calibration | Validation | Total |
|--------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| SIR-Network | 3h | 1h | 1h | 5h |
| SDE | 2h | 2h | 1h | 5h |
| **Combined** | 5h | 3h | 2h | **10h** |

### Time-Based Recommendations

| Time Remaining | Recommended Approach |
|----------------|---------------------|
| < 12 hours | SIR-Network only |
| 12-24 hours | SIR-Network + basic uncertainty |
| 24-48 hours | SIR-Network + SDE validation |
| > 48 hours | Full multi-method + ABM micro-validation |
