# Task Decomposition Templates

## Source
MM_Assets_Export/decompose_prompt.json (62KB)

## Contents
- 6 problem type templates (A, B, C, D, E, F)
- Each contains 3-5 subtask decomposition patterns
- Includes theoretical and practical approach variants
- Dependency analysis templates

## Usage
1. Identify problem type (A-F)
2. Load corresponding template from decompose_prompt.json
3. Adapt to specific problem requirements
4. Generate subtasks with dependency analysis

## Agent Integration
- Primary: @researcher (Phase 0-1)
- Secondary: @director (coordination awareness)

## Problem Types

### Type A: Continuous Optimization Problems
Characteristics: Objective function, constraints, continuous variables
Examples: Linear programming, nonlinear optimization

### Type B: Discrete/Combinatorial Problems
Characteristics: Integer variables, combinatorial structure
Examples: Scheduling, routing, assignment

### Type C: Prediction/Forecasting Problems
Characteristics: Historical data, future values, uncertainty
Examples: Time series, regression, machine learning

### Type D: Evaluation/Selection Problems
Characteristics: Multiple criteria, alternatives, ranking
Examples: AHP, TOPSIS, multi-criteria decision making

### Type E: Simulation/Modeling Problems
Characteristics: System dynamics, agent-based, stochastic
Examples: Monte Carlo, discrete event simulation

### Type F: Classification/Clustering Problems
Characteristics: Unsupervised or supervised learning
Examples: K-means, neural networks, decision trees
