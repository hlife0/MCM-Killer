## How to Use

1. **Check relevance**: Find your agent in "Quick Reference"
2. **Read summary**: Go to your phase section
3. **Access resource**: Use the path provided (format: `past_work/active/PWK_xxx/content.{ext}`)
4. **Priority**: Use past work insights BEFORE external resources
5. **If helpful**: Cite appropriately in paper

**Note**: Past work resources are PRE-APPROVED (75/100) and should be consulted FIRST.
Internal knowledge (HMML 2.0) still takes ultimate priority.
