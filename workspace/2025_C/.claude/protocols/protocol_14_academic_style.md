# Protocol 14: Academic Style Alignment

> **Purpose**: Ensure writing matches O-Prize paper standards
> **Applies To**: @writer, @editor
> **Based On**: knowledge_library/academic_writing/style_guide.md

## Core Principle

O-Prize papers follow specific stylistic conventions. We must match them.

## Style Guide Source

The file `knowledge_library/academic_writing/style_guide.md` is generated by:
- @knowledge_librarian in Phase -1 (Pre-Game)
- Analyzing reference_papers/ (44 O-Prize winners)
- Extracting statistical patterns

## Key Style Rules

### 1. Abstract Structure

**Required Elements** (100% of O-Prize papers):
- Problem statement (1-2 sentences)
- Method description (2-3 sentences)
- ≥3 quantitative results
- Policy/domain implication (1 sentence)

**Quantitative Density**:
- Minimum: 3 numbers
- Target: 5-7 numbers
- Maximum: 200 words total

### 2. Verb Usage

**High-Value Verbs** (from O-Prize analysis):
- ✅ demonstrate, reveal, indicate, suggest, confirm, enable
- ✅ quantify, elucidate, validate, establish, characterize
- ❌ Avoid: show, display, present (purely descriptive)

### 3. Sentence Complexity

**Target Range**:
- Average: 18-22 words/sentence
- Maximum: 30 words/sentence
- Use active voice ≥60% of time

### 4. Section Length Ratios

**Typical O-Prize Distribution**:
- Introduction: 15-20% of paper
- Methods: 30-35%
- Results: 25-30%
- Discussion: 20-25%
- Conclusion: 5%

### 5. Figure Caption Style

**Required Format**:
```
Figure N: [Title]. [Observation sentence with numbers], [Implication
sentence starting with "indicating/demonstrating/revealing"]. [Optional
additional detail].
```

**Length**: 2-4 sentences, 30-60 words

### 6. Citation Density

**Target**: 15-25 citations total
- Introduction: 40% of citations
- Methods: 30%
- Discussion: 30%

## Enforcement Workflow

### Phase 8: @writer

When generating LaTeX:
1. Read style_guide.md FIRST
2. Use verb lists from style guide
3. Match sentence length distribution
4. Follow figure caption templates

### Phase 8.5: @editor

When reviewing draft:
1. Check abstract has ≥3 numbers
2. Verify figure captions follow Protocol 15 (Observation-Implication)
3. Flag weak verbs for replacement
4. Measure section length ratios

### Quality Checklist

Before passing paper to @judge_zero:
- [ ] Abstract contains ≥3 quantitative metrics
- [ ] No banned verbs (show, display) in results
- [ ] All figures have Observation-Implication captions
- [ ] Section ratios within ±5% of style guide
- [ ] Active voice ≥60%
- [ ] Average sentence length 18-22 words

## Example: Before & After

### Before (Non-compliant)

```latex
\section{Results}
Figure 3 shows the model performance. The accuracy is good.
We achieved an R-squared value of 0.89.
```

**Problems**:
- "shows" is banned
- "good" is vague
- No implication
- Passive voice

### After (Compliant)

```latex
\section{Results}
Figure 3 demonstrates that our hierarchical network model achieves
RMSE = 4.2 (95% CI: 3.8-4.6), indicating accurate prediction within
±4.2 cases per region. The model explains 89% of variance (R² = 0.89,
p < 0.001), suggesting that the remaining 11% reflects acknowledged
regional heterogeneity beyond network topology.
```

**Improvements**:
- "demonstrates" (high-value verb)
- Quantitative (4.2, 95% CI, 89%, p-value)
- Observation + Implication
- Active voice
- Sentence length: 21 words (target range)

## Integration with Protocol 15

Protocol 14 (Style) and Protocol 15 (Observation-Implication) work together:
- **Protocol 14**: Governs verb choice, sentence structure, ratios
- **Protocol 15**: Governs result statement structure

Both are enforced by @editor before @judge_zero review.

## Limitations Presentation

**Aligned with Reference Papers**:
- Use dedicated subsection for limitations (optional but recommended)
- Bullet-point format for multiple related limitations
- Transparent acknowledgment builds credibility
- Reference: 2009116.pdf (explicit limitations section with 6+ items)

**Tone Guidelines**:
- Technical and neutral, not defensive
- Acknowledge while demonstrating competence
- Connect to future work when appropriate
- Example: "The model exhibits prediction error when external variables change significantly, suggesting integration of additional covariates as future work."

**What to Include**:
- Technical limitations (data constraints, assumptions)
- Methodological boundaries (scope conditions)
- Performance characteristics (accuracy tradeoffs)

**What to Exclude**:
- Development struggles (debugging stories)
- Emotional language (frustration, breakthroughs)
- Narrative journey (failed attempts that led nowhere)
